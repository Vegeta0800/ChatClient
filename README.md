To use:

Go to the main.cpp and change the DEFAULT_PORT to whatever you set and forwarded in the server main.cpp.

Then:
If you are in the same network as the server host:
  Use the IPv4 LAN Address (192. ...) of the server host and insert it into the define SERVER_IP
If outside the network:
  Use the public IPv4 Address (whatismyipaddress.com) of the server host and insert it into the define SERVER_IP
